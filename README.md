# blender-render-notif6
this is a addon to notify you after a render is completed 
innstall the .py file and check the checkbox that says render complete sound and then in preferances add the sound you want to play prefferably in .wav form make sure its atleast 5 seconds long so you dont miss the sound as it sometimes cuts in the start. if you like what i did you can email me at dlohar475@gmail.com to thank me or pay me. its free!
